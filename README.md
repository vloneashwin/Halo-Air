Mission Planner
Mission Planner is a comprehensive ground control station (GCS) software used in conjunction with ArduPilot, an open-source autopilot system for drones and other unmanned vehicles. 
Mission Planner serves a dual purpose: it allows users to control the drone and simultaneously gather detailed data about its performance and status.
With Mission Planner, users can plan and execute missions by defining waypoints, flight paths, and other commands, which the drone then autonomously follows. 
This planning capability is invaluable for various applications, including aerial surveys, agricultural monitoring, search and rescue operations, and more. 
The software provides an intuitive interface where users can input mission parameters and visualize the planned route on a map.
